> The task involves creating a React and Redux-based landing page for a book catalog system. It includes features such as user authentication, a list of recently added books, a search function, filtering options, book details display with reviews, editing and deleting books, and the ability to add new books with success/failure notifications. Additionally, there's a wishlist feature for users to mark books they want to read, along with options for marking books as finished reading or in progress.
